# Making mobile apps using Fuse
Sathurday 21 November 2015

There's a new kid in town! In October 2015 the peoples over at Fuse announced their new UX tool suite for building awesome mobile applications. A tool meant to bring designers and developer closer.

There are of course other tools out there letting you create and deploy application on multiple platforms. But the new cool thing about Fuse is its ability to push updates to the look and feel on multiple devices in real time while designing and developing. This makes the process from the designers to the implementation by the developers work more seamlessly.

To get started the Fuse team themselves are providing great tutorial videos. They also has a documentation section on their site with enough information to get around. It could of course be more comprehensive, but for now it's ok.

The first time I got to try the tools was back in 2013, and a lot have been changed. With the new UX Markup and the integration of JavaScript you can easily get around creating good looking apps in no time.

For the more advanced users, Fuse lets you access the native Android and iOS APIs directly using Uno. Unis is a native C# dialect. And if you have been using C# nearly everything you're known to will apply in Uno code.

  </DockPanel>
</App>
